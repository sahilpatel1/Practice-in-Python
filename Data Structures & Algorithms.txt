1. Graph Algorithms

-Breadth First Search (BFS)
-Depth First Search (DFS)
-Shortest Path from source to all vertices Dijkstra
-Shortest Path from every vertex to every other vertex Floyd Warshall
-Minimum Spanning tree Prim
-Minimum Spanning tree Kruskal
-Topological Sort
-Johnson's algorithm
-Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices) in a graph
-Bridges in a graph

2. Dynamic Programming (process to solve optimization problems)
(is applicable when subproblems are not independent)
(solve every subsubproblem only once and store the answer
for use when it reappears)

Note: A divide-and-conquer approach will do more work
than necessary

-Longest Increasing Subsequence
-Edit Distance
